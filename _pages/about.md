Welcome to **SHIELD**, a research project focused on advancing the understanding and prediction of crime hotspots to enhance public safety. SHIELD leverages cutting-edge data analysis, machine learning, and spatial modeling techniques to identify and mitigate risks in urban environments.

**Objectives**

- Crime Hotspot Prediction: Develop accurate models to forecast areas with a high likelihood of criminal activity.
- Risk Assessment: Analyze patterns and trends to evaluate crime risk in various regions.
- Public Safety: Provide insights and tools to support safety measures and policy-making.

**Features**

- Data-Driven Insights: Utilize large-scale crime data and advanced analytics to uncover patterns.
- Machine Learning Models: Apply state-of-the-art algorithms for risk and hotspot prediction.
- Interactive Visualization: Enable stakeholders to visualize crime trends and potential risks effectively.
- Collaborative Approach: Engage with communities, researchers, and policymakers for impactful solutions.
